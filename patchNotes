OLD GL & glut

Currently I'm inspired by our RS-001 badge we got by registring our project.
Hence I decided to form a skelet for the project.

The "window part" of the app is the smallest part of the code, whichever lib
we use. The main part of the code of the first itteration of the app will be
terrain generation, pathfinding etc. Not the drawing and the shaders! The frame of
the app is to be set in glut and old open gl wich should later be easily replaced.
In this frame we can work on algorithms and data structures needed for the app.
This can be done quickly and it will serve as fallback option if shortage of time
comes te bite us. Also we will have to write modular code to easily replace the
"old" parts, if replacement comes to be.

CAMERA & PLAYER

For now there is no player entity. The camera is the player. When camera gets
attach methods and apropriate look methods that take user input as arguments
we will attach camera to the entity - the player!
